# Module 12 SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker

## Description

This is a command-line application that provides an interactive interface for managing a company's employee database. The motivation behind this project was to create a tool that makes it easy for non-technical users to view and interact with information stored in a database. The application solves the problem of navigating through complex database structures, making it simple and intuitive to manage a company's departments, roles, and employees. During the development of this project, we learned how to build command-line applications using Node.js, interact with a MySQL database, and implement user interfaces with Inquirer.js.
